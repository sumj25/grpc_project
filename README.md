# gRPC Example in Go

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of **gRPC** in Go. The application includes both client and server implementations, showcasing unary RPC, server-side streaming, client-side streaming, and bidirectional streaming.

---

## Features

- **Unary RPC**: The client sends a single request and receives a single response.
- **Server Streaming RPC**: The server streams multiple responses for a single client request.
- **Client Streaming RPC**: The client streams multiple requests to the server, and the server responds with a single response.
- **Bidirectional Streaming RPC**: Both the client and server send streams of data to each other.
